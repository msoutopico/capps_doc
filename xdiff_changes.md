# xDiff changes: 

* 2020-10-06: Only latest 100 reports are shown. Improved performance. Older reports are still available on demand.
* 2020-10-06: Non-admin users can only see reports they have created or for containers and languages their VegaSuite credentials have assigned.
* 2020-10-06: The Settings tab is gone, since one option there had and might never been implemented, and the other one does not really make sense.

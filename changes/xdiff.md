# xDiff change history: 

### 2020-10-06
* Only latest 100 reports are shown. Improved performance. Older reports are still available on demand.
* Non-admin users can only see reports they have created or for containers and languages their VegaSuite credentials have assigned.
* The Settings tab is gone, since one option there had and might never been implemented, and the other one does not really make sense.

### 2020-11-15
* Arabic/Hebrew text had wrong left-to-right direction -> correct RTL direction now
* Font used (Rockwell) in cells did not display all languages clearly -> changed to Segoe UI
* Clean-up button had an unclear name -> renamed as to reflect what it actually does
